# Summary
The client, UNMC Water, Climate and Health working group is interested in understanding how temperature, humidity, elevation and geographic location have an impact on the air quality here in Nebraska. 

UNMC asked for the locations with the highest meana and median concentration values of VOC, PM2.5, PM10.0 and where these values took place. They also wanted to know the maximum values of VOC, PM2.5, PM10.0. 
Like stated before they were interested if temperature and humidity have an affect on the air quality. 
Finally they wanted to know where and when PM2.5 and PM10.0 have been unhealthy for sensitive populations according to EPA's Air Quality Index.
